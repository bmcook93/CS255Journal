    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    DriverPass, a company specializing in online and in-person driving training support for aspiring students, needed a web-based platformed to host their courses, payment packages, and appointment information. This project aimed to fulfill those needs.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    My work on the business requirement documents I feel that I did very well on. There is room for further detail on specific features, but I feel as though I have successfully captured the needs of client based on the interview with the boss and IT manager of DriverPass.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    I would likely focus on further detailing the diagrams I created to visualize the flow of the system as users utilize it. There is room for improvement on exception handling methods and potential other inputs from the user's end.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    DriverPass had ideas about how they wanted the system to run, and by visualizing those needs and using knowledge from both a business and technical standpoint, I was able to come up with solutions which were recorded in the Business Requirements Document. This is important, as the customer's needs should be at the forefront of the analysts mind. They have the vision for the program and software they want to support their efforts, and as an analyst, my primary job is encompass all of their needs.
    
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    Gathering requirements from the user is the first step to designing software. Understanding all of their needs helps when it comes to the actual design process later on in the cycle. I believe the best strategy to employ for this is to have a direct, face-to-face interview with either the users or the business to understand their ideal system.
